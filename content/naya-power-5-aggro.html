<p>This deck is great about putting down at least one huge threat a turn by turn 5 at the latest. Starting with a Bird, Forest and another land means I can drop a <%= link_card 'Woolly Thoctar' %> on turn 2, then a <%= link_card 'Cliffrunner Behemoth' %> on turn 3, hitting for 10 with life link.</p>

<p><%= link_card 'Drumhunter' %> keeps (and possibly speeds up) my tempo. Getting the <%= link_card 'Where Ancients Tread' %> is a great damage dealer along with the additional creature threat.</p>

<p>Besides the <%= link_card 'Baneslayer Angel' %>, I don't have a good answer to fliers. <%= link_card 'Bitterblossom' %> would probably ruin my day. Needs more  and less spells.</p>
